# Welcome!
My name is Rory Patrick Sheridan and I'm a newly certified Full-Stack Software Developer. I'm currently travelling and working in Europe. I have a small portfolio here, with quite a few more projects in the works. Take a look and let me know what you think, any suggestion or ideas are welcomed. ðŸ˜Š

Right now I'm studying to improve my current proficiencies, learn a language for mobile development, such as React Native and utilise analytics.

You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.1]][1] for my work history, or you can check out my favourite hobby, photography, on [![Instagram][2.1]][2]

## Current Projects
### Chi Sono Io
<a href="https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/chi-sono-io"><img align="left" src="https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/Ri-Dearg/raw/main/CHI.SONO.IO%20_%20IO.png" alt="Chi-Sono-Io"><a/>
A draft gallery website for a photography project of mine which has been awarded funding from Caritas Italiana. The aim is to bring public awareness of migrants, not as "migrants" but as people like all of us through stories which recall common human emotions and themes like family or celebration. Unfortunately, due to Covid restrictions, the project has been put on hold indefinitely.

## Portfolio Sites
### Full-Stack Showcase - Neverlost Thrift

An e-commerce site built with Django and PostgreSQL, featuring search, tags, ajax forms, likes, infinite scroll, sorting stock by data, user accounts, automated emails, and a fully functional payment system using Stripe. It was inspired by thrift stores and charity shops and the design followed suit. Check out the README.md for detailed info.
  

### Database Focused Showcase - Corona Tales

A text-based social network built with Flask and MongoDB, featuring a cusomtised text editor, Materialize CSS, a complex search system, tags, ajax forms, likes, infinite scroll, user accounts with complex options, and automated emails. The idea came from the wide variety of unique emotions and experiences people underwent during the pandemic. As always, take a look at the README.md for more info.
  

### Frontend Focused Showcase - Horizon Photo
<a href="https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/horizon-photo"><img align="right" src="https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/Ri-Dearg/raw/main/Horizon%20Photography%20_%20Home.png" alt="Frontend Showcase"><a/>
A portfolio for a travel blogger built with Bootstrap 4 and Javascript, featuring animations, Google Maps API, REST Countries API, API failure fallback, EmailJS, responsive gallery, progressive image loading and interaction between the current page and an iframe. Imagined as a site with a minimal aesthetic to showcase a phtographer's work. Clciking on a marker swaps the iframe for new photos. Again, take a look at the README.md for more info.
